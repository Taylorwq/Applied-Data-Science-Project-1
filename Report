## Data Cleaning
The datasets used in this project come from multiple sources, including daily financial market data (USD/JPY exchange rate, gold price, S&P 500 index), US Treasury yields (2-year, 5-year, and 10-year), and monthly macroeconomic indicators (unemployment rate and CPI). Because this data comes from different providers and is released at varying frequencies, several data cleaning steps were required before analysis. Column names were standardized to remove special characters and unify formatting; all date variables were converted to date-time formats for time series alignment. The datasets were sorted chronologically before merging. A key challenge was reconciling the frequency differences, as financial variables are recorded daily, while macroeconomic indicators are reported monthly. To address this, we used forward imputation interpolation to resample the monthly macroeconomic data to daily frequencies, ensuring that each trading day reflects the latest available macroeconomic information. Missing values ​​in the Treasury yield data (typically occurring on non-trading days) were also forward imputed to maintain data continuity. No duplicate observations were found. Potential outliers were identified through descriptive statistical analysis. All observed extreme values ​​were consistent with known economic events, such as pandemic-related surges in unemployment and post-pandemic interest rate increases. Since these fluctuations reflected real market conditions rather than data entry errors, no observations were removed. Following these steps, the final dataset remained consistent in time sequence, contained no duplicate entries, and had a consistent structure for all variables, providing a reliable foundation for subsequent analysis.
